# Integer right triangles
#
# Problem 39
# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c},
# there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
#
# {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
#
# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# This is a forbenius problem. There are polynomial time solutions to this.
